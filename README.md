This MASM program focuses on string processing and integer conversion using macros and procedures. It includes:

1. The program implements two macros: mGetString and mDisplayString. The mGetString macro displays a prompt and retrieves user keyboard input, storing it in a memory location. It also handles input length and byte count. The mDisplayString macro prints a string from a specified memory location.

2. The program implements two procedures for signed integers: ReadVal and WriteVal. The ReadVal procedure uses the mGetString macro to obtain user input as a string of digits, converts the ASCII digits to numeric SDWORD values, validates input, and stores the value in a memory variable. The WriteVal procedure converts a numeric SDWORD value to a string of ASCII digits and uses the mDisplayString macro to print it.

3. The test program (in main) employs the ReadVal and WriteVal procedures to:
	- Get 10 valid integers from the user using a loop and ReadVal.
	- Store these numeric values in an array.
	- Display the integers, their sum, and their integer part of the average.

In summary, this MASM program demonstrates the use of macros and procedures to handle string processing and integer conversion tasks, while also testing their functionality in a program that obtains user input, performs calculations, and displays the results.
